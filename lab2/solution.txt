1. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the
file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? To answer this question, it’s probably easiest to select an HTTP message and
explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected
packet header window”.
Source ip -192.168.1.102
Source port - 1161
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments
for this connection?
Ip address of gaia server -- 128.119.245.12
It is sending and recieving through port 80 which is a standard for HTTP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between
the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYN
segment?
SeqNo 0 is used to initiate a TCP connection. A SYN flag which is set (1) identifies it as a SYN segment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in
reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment? How did
gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK
segment?
SeqNo 0 is also used in reply to the client. Acknowledgement field is set to 1; Both SYN and ACK flags are set which identifies it as SYN ACK segment.
The value of the acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment is determined by adding 1 to the initial sequence number of SYN segment from the client computer 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command? Note that in order
to find the POST command; you’ll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom of the Wireshark
window, looking for a segment with a “POST” within its DATA field.
164041 is the seqNo for HTTP POST command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first segment in the TCP connection. What are
the sequence numbers of the first six segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing
the HTTP POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each segment received?
Given the difference between when each TCP segment was sent, and when its acknowledgement was
received, what is the RTT value for each of the six segments?
The HTTP POST segment is considered as the first segment. Segments 1 – 6 are No. 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 
        and 11 in this trace respectively. The ACKs of segments 1 – 6 are No. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, and 16
        in this trace.
        Segment 1 sequence number: 1 
        Segment 2 sequence number: 566
        Segment 3 sequence number: 2026
        Segment 4 sequence number: 3486
        Segment 5 sequence number: 4946 
        Segment 6 sequence number: 6406
		
Below is the list of SENT time - RECEIVED time - RTT :
Seg 1 - 0.026477 - 0.053937 - 0.02746
Seg 2 - 0.041737 - 0.077294 - 0.035557
Seg 3 - 0.054026 - 0.124085 - 0.070059
Seg 4 - 0.054690 - 0.169118 - 0.11443
Seg 5 - 0.077405 - 0.217299 - 0.13989
Seg 6 - 0.078157 - 0.267802 - 0.18964

EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * EstimatedRTT + 0.125 * SampleRTT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. What is the length of each of the first six TCP segments?
The length of the first TCP segment is 565 bytes. The length of each of the following five TCP segments is 1460 bytes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What is the minimum amount of available buffer space advertised at the received for the entire trace? Does
the lack of receiver buffer space ever throttle the sender?
The minimum amount of buffer space advertised at the received for the entire trace - 5840.
No.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Are there any retransmitted segments in the trace file? What did you check for (in the trace) in order to
answer this question?
No, there isn't any retransmitted segments in the trace file. I checked the sequence graph to answer this question.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How much data does the receiver typically acknowledge in an ACK? Can you identify cases where the
receiver is ACKing every other received segment.
Data typically acknowledged by the receiver in an ACK - 1460.
The cases in 78 & 79 show where the reciever is acking every other segment ie 1460*2=2920 bytes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What is the throughput (bytes transferred per unit time) for the TCP connection? Explain how you
calculated this value.

Time of First segment= 0.026477
Time of Last segment= 5.455830
 SeqNo of first segment=1
SeqNo of last segment=164091 
Total data transfered = 164091-1 = 164090
Total time taken= 5.455830 - 0.026477 =5.4294 seconds.
Hence total speed= 164090/5.4294=30.222 KB/sec
